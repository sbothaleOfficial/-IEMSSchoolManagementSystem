## How to Run & Test

### üöÄ **RECOMMENDED METHODS:**

#### **Development Mode (Always Latest Code):**
```cmd
# Method 1: Direct run from source (fastest for development)
cd C:\Users\SP\Development\IEMSSchoolManagementSystem
dotnet run --project IEMS.WPF

# Method 2: Use the automated script
Double-click "RunLatest.cmd"
```

#### **Published Mode (Standalone Executable):**
